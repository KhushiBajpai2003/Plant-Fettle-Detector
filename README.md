PLANT FETTLE DETECTOR - Unifying Fruit Quality Tracking and Plant Disease Detection through Advanced Image Analysis.
This research presents an innovative integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address key challenges in agricultureâ€”fruit quality tracking and plant disease detection. The unified system comprises the Fruit Quality Tracker and the Plant Disease Detector, leveraging advanced image analysis for precision agriculture. The Fruit Quality Tracker uses computer vision to assess ripeness and defects in real-time, empowering farmers with informed decisions. Simultaneously, the Plant Disease Detector swiftly identifies and classifies diseases, mitigating economic losses.
